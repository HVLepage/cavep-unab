            <p>
              The project involves a number of parallel studies. We shall be investigating water quality in two catchments and at an upland reservoir using both traditional methods ofwater testing and the Cambridge in-situ tagging technology. We will be investigating water quality in two catchments and one irrigation project as detailed in the mapped sites below. This will map the presence of contaminants and attempt identification of sources of those contaminants. This component of the study program will adopt tried and tested methods to produce a picture of water, soil and enviromnental quality throughout Barranca Province.
